The Autorickshaw Management App is a mobile application built using React Native. It is designed to simplify the management and operations of autorickshaws. This app provides a comprehensive solution for autorickshaw drivers and fleet owners to streamline their daily tasks, track their vehicles, manage bookings, and enhance overall efficiency.

### Features
**Vehicle Tracking:** The app allows autorickshaw drivers and fleet owners to track their vehicles in real-time on a map. This feature helps them monitor the location, speed, and route of each autorickshaw, ensuring better control over operations and improved safety.  


**Booking Management**: Users can receive and manage booking requests through the app. The app displays detailed information about the pickup and drop-off locations, along with customer details. It also allows drivers to accept or decline bookings, helping them efficiently plan their schedules.  


**Navigation**: The app integrates with navigation services, enabling drivers to navigate to the customer's location and the desired destination effortlessly. It provides turn-by-turn directions, estimated time of arrival, and alternate routes if needed.   

  
**Driver Profile**: Each driver can create and manage their profile within the app. They can update their personal details, upload a profile picture, and view their booking history. This feature helps drivers build trust and credibility with their customers.

**Payment Integration**: The app incorporates secure payment gateways, allowing customers to make cashless payments for their rides. Drivers can also track their earnings and view payment history through the app.

**Feedback and Rating**: After completing a ride, customers can provide feedback and ratings for the driver. This feature encourages drivers to maintain high-quality service and improves customer satisfaction.
